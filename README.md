# AngryBirds

I took a game physics class and the result is two working(ish) levels from Angry Birds.
I learned the hard way what bad OO design will do to you. I'm still in the process of cleaning up the code base (after
having done research on Game Engines and Game coding practices) and hopefully I'll get the chance to overhaul a lot of 
the crazy hierarchies soon. 

Azul.cpp is where the main game loop is located.  The libraries were not my creation but were a part of the Azul engine the class
was given at the start of the quarter.
